      <h1>Surface Regolith on the Red Planet</h1>

      <p>
        Surface regolith on the red planet presents a loose, granular layer that blankets nearly every exposed region.
        This material forms through billions of years of impact fragmentation, volcanic output, plus physical weathering
        in a cold, thin gaseous envelope rich in carbon oxide. Grains range from fine silt to coarse sand, with occasional
        larger rock fragments scattered across plains plus crater rims. Texture often appears powdery, yet electrostatic
        forces can produce slight cohesion under certain conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Color trends toward rusty orange or reddish brown. This hue results largely from ferric oxide coatings that surround
        individual particles. Spectral observations from orbiters plus rover-based instruments reveal basaltic origin for much
        of this regolith. Basalt forms through volcanic processes, suggesting early, widespread volcanic activity. Crustal rock
        subsequently breaks down into smaller particles through impact shocks, thermal cycling, plus mechanical stress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chemical surveys detect perchlorate salts in several landing sites. Perchlorates remain stable in cold, arid settings yet
        become reactive under heating. Such compounds pose toxicity risks for potential biological systems. Sulfates, chlorides,
        plus silica-rich phases also occur. Oxidizing agents, possibly generated through ultraviolet radiation acting on surface salts,
        create a highly reactive chemical environment. Organic carbon appears scarce at exposed surface levels, though subsurface niches
        could preserve trace residues from earlier epochs.

      <p>
        Physical properties differ strongly from typical terrestrial soils. True soil on Earth results from biological plus chemical
        weathering interacting with liquid water plus organic input. Regolith on this planet lacks sustained liquid water activity at
        present surface pressure plus temperature. Consequently, no stable horizon structure develops. Instead, vertical mixing occurs
        through impact gardening, dust transport, plus seasonal frost deposition. Porosity often remains high, bulk density relatively low,
        yet compaction increases with depth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thermal behavior reflects extreme daily temperature variation. Surface grains experience rapid heating under solar input, followed by swift
        cooling after sunset. Repeated expansion plus contraction contributes to granular breakdown. Wind, though acting within a thin gaseous envelope,
        still transports fine dust across vast distances. Global dust events periodically lift particles high into the atmosphere, reducing visibility
        plus altering energy balance for weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Radiation flux at surface level exceeds typical terrestrial background due to absence of a dense atmosphere plus global magnetic shielding.
        High-energy particles penetrate upper regolith layers, inducing chemical alteration plus gradual degradation of potential organic molecules.
        Subsurface zones beyond several centimeters may offer partial protection from such radiation.
      </p>

      <p class="dense">
        Water exists primarily as ice in polar regions plus beneath certain mid-latitude terrains. In these cold reservoirs, regolith can contain frozen brine mixtures.
        Transient brine formation under rare favorable conditions remains a working theory rather than confirmed fact, since direct observation proves challenging.
        Fine dust particles adhere readily to equipment through electrostatic charging. Abrasion risk for mechanical systems remains significant. Yet regolith also offers
        raw material for construction, radiation shielding, plus extraction of oxygen from oxide minerals through reduction processes. Engineering feasibility studies explore
        sintering regolith into solid blocks or extracting useful elements via thermal treatment. Though superficially similar to terrestrial desert soil, it lacks biological
        integration plus stable liquid water processes that define true soil systems. Any future agricultural use would require extensive chemical treatment, perchlorate removal,
        plus controlled hydration within protected habitats.
